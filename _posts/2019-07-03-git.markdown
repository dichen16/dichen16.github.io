## remote operation

After I forked a project(e.g. Envoy), it may be outdated, then how to update the local, outdated, forked project.

> [Git rebase from remote fork repo](https://gist.github.com/ravibhure/a7e0918ff4937c9ea1c456698dcd58aa)

- git clone https://github.com/dichen16/envoy.git
- git remote add upstream https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy.git
- git fetch upstream
- git rebase upstream/master [--force-rebase, -f]
- git push -f origin master

## undoing 

Talk about how to discard changes since your last commit, amending commits, cherry-picking hashes, resetting to a specific commit, and reverting to a specific commit.

- git checkout <file>
- git commit --amend [--no-edit]
- git reflog
- git reset <hash>
- git reset <file> # staging file to untracked file
- git revert

## stash 

When you have some changes that you want to save but aren't ready to make a commit or you need to switch branches. Changes will be saved in a temporary place

- git stash save "type your message here"
- git stash list
- git stash apply stash@{0} 
- git stash pop # pop out(drop) stash@{0} 
-  git stash clear

## check

- git log --stat
- git config --list

## troubleshooting

- Error when `$git push origin master` 

```bash
$ git push orgin master
To https://github.com/dichen16/dichen16.github.io.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/dichen16/dichen16.github.io.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

[出界大王@dilaptop dichen16.github.io]$ git status
On branch master
Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
and have 1 and 1 different commits each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)
